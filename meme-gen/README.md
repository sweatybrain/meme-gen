hello! this was a very difficult project to follow along and i believe it didnt even end up as good as i thought
it could get. anyways! this project is some sort of meme generator, where you can input text and the page will
generate a random image that is fetched from a meme image api. this was all done using react, with react useState,
useEffect and a lot of javascript fundamentals such as fetch to grab data. 

this was a scrimba 5hours-long exercise wow, can't believe i made it alive in the end. in this exercise, we could
grasp and understand how useState and useEffect work a little better in React.

quick start:

```
$ yarn # npm install
$ yarn build # npm run build
````

## Development

Run Webpack in watch-mode to continually compile the JavaScript as you work:

```
$ yarn watch # npm run watch
```
